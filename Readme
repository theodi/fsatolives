# FSA to LIVES

A script that automagically converts Food Standard Agency open data into Yelp-compative [LIVES](http://www.yelp.com/healthscores) data.

## Getting this up and running

To make sure we can check the town and county names, we'll be importing the [Ordnance Survey 50k Gazetter](http://www.ordnancesurvey.co.uk/business-and-government/products/50k-gazetteer.html) (data is included in this repo), so we'll need to make sure we have a database installed (in this case MongoDB). If you haven't got Mongo installed, [follow these instructions](http://docs.mongodb.org/manual/installation/).

Then it's just a case of cloning this repo, and running the following commands:

  * `bundle install`
  * `rake import`
  
You can then get a LIVES-compliant zipfile generated by running the command:

    rake create id={FSA authority ID}
